        <p>Hi! I'm Arlo and this is my 'About Me' page. I have three cats named Stinky, Bean, and Thelma, who I love very much. 
            I have my B.A. in Digital Arts and Sciences and my A.A. in Art. 
            My favorite pasttime is chilling with my cats while listening to music, but I also enjoy drawing and spending time with my girlfriend.
